# Guidelines for interviewers

1. Your primary task is to find cheaters. But this is nothing you should tell the teams: they may get scared and nervous. 

2. No part of their robot should have been done by teachers, parents or other adults. The team must have built the robot and created the full program by themselves. They are allowed to ask "experts" for help, but they need to understand every part of their robot and program, and they should be able to reproduce it without any further external help. 

3. Following the above the teams are not allowed to inherit a robot from a previous team without understanding how it works. They should be able to reproduce the full robot without any external help. 

4. You should be nice and kind to the teams so that they are comfortable to open up themselves for you. Many participants are just 10-12 years old and not used to explain their thoughts and work â€“ especially not in English. All kids should leave the competition venue with positive memories and they should be inspired to continue playing with robotics, and develop their interest in science. Be nice and careful! 

5. Be curious! Ask questions about what they have done. Ask them how they have thought! Many kids love to have your full attention and someone that listens to them without distraction. Turn off your phone and do not get interrupted during an interview session. Try to really understand how the team has reasoned and thought when they built and programmed their robot. 

6. It is good if you have prepared yourself by reading the code, BOM (bill of materials) and Engineering Journal of the team before meeting them. It is also good if you have some experience with the different programming languages that are popular, some common languages are: NXC, NXT-G, EV3-G, Lejos, RobotC, LabView, fischertechnik, C++, Java and Python. 

7. It is good to know a lot of languages. If necessary I take the interview in their native language. For example I have taken interviews in Spanish, English and Swedish. But the best is of course to take it in English so other people can listen and take part of the sharing experience.
