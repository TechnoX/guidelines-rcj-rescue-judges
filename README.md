# General guidelines for Line and Maze

1. Be kind to the teams. Treat them well. Don't be upset even if the team is upset. Be calm and explain for them the situation. 

2. Be fair. If you have done a misstake tell the main judge immediately. She/He may decide to continue with this misstake during the tournament to have a fair competition for everyone. 

3. If unsure about anything, ask the main judge. If he is also unsure, judge in favor for the team. But be consistent with all previous decisions during the tournament. 

4. No practise on the competition fields. Never during the tournament. 

5. Try to not influence the team, even if you want to help them to understand the rules it is their task, not yours. The problem is if teams get different help from different judges. You should never have a favorite team, treat every team the same. 
For example never tell the team that "it is good to place a checkpoint marker on tiles with several passes of strategical reasons (see point 4 in line below)". It should be the team that thinks about these kind of decisions. 

6. The robot is defined as "all parts still fixed to the robot, including but not limited to cables, ropes and textile". Nuts and bolts that the robot have lost during the run is not considered the robot. However they are not allowed to remount such parts.  

*(Recursive definition when it refers to the term robot itself???)*

7. The team is not allowed to modify or repair a robot after the scoring run has started. If the robot loses anything the parts will remain in the field until the run is over. You or the team is not allowed to move the lost parts. 

8. It is never okay to share any information&ast; of the field with the robot. 
Information sharing can happen in several ways, for example but not limited to: Buttons, gyro-sensors sensing rotation of the robot in the air, distance sensors sensing the wall configuration (and team placing the robot in a certain way to tell the robot something), light sensors that the team cover in a certain configuration during a LoP. 
Look for this and tell the main judge as soon as you suspect anything. Don't tell the team because we don't want fair teams to feel guilty, and we don't want cheating teams to be more careful of what they do. 


# Notes for Rescue Line Judges: 

&ast; Information that is OK to tell the robot beforehand is the inclination of the ramp, the width of the line, the color values of intersection markers. 

Information that NOT is OK to tell the robot is the location or size of the obstacles, the placement of the evacuation point if it is better to go right or left around obstacles, the number of checkpoint markers, etc. Everything that can vary between different runs. 


1. "Reached checkpoint" is defined as "more than half of the robot is within the tile marked with a checkpoint marker, when seen from above. ".

*(What if the robot is growing larger than 2 tiles, then the robot will never be more than half inside any single tile??)*

2. During a LoP the team is not allowed to modify / repair / change the robot, in any way. For example, but not limited to, fastening wheels or bolts, manually rotate wheels, push buttons (except restart procedure), changing the equipment for victim rescuing (like manually elevating a arm). 

3. In case of a LoP the robot should restart on the last visited checkpoint tile. No part of the robot is allowed to protrude from the checkpoint tile when seen from above. 
The direction of the robot should be in the direction of the path toward the evacuation zone (this is to prevent teams giving the robot information about the field).

4. If the checkpoint tile is located on a tile where the line passes several times, the team can use it as recovery point every time the robot passes the checkpoint. 

5. The team needs to explicitly place a checkpoint marker before the evacuation zone, to be able to restart there after a LoP in the evacuation zone. 

6. The team should select the location of the checkpoint markers. The team places the checkpoint markers in the field (but they need to be within one single tile when looking from above). Each field design has a predesignated number of checkpoint markers. All markers have to be used. 

7. To place the checkpoint markers (and to calibrate the robot) should be done within the 8 minutes for the run. 

8. The victims should be dropped from the center of the evacuation zone and they should roll to their positions by themselves. You as judge should never touches the victims and push them to new locations after they are dropped (since it can be seen as you are helping the running team, or making it harder for the specific team). 

9. The placement of the evacuation point will be done using a dice. 1&2 is corner 1, 3&4 is corner 2, 5&6 is corner 3. You can decide the numbering of the corners as long as you are consistent between runs. 

10. The evacuation point can be moved manually if you suspect the team is cheating. For example if the robot is going straight toward the correct corner every try in the evacuation zone you can move the evacuation point to another corner, even without using the dice.
Please inform the main judge as soon as possible, if you have done this for a team. 

11. The team is not allowed to move to the next droptile before they have done 3 attempts. But there is nothing that requires the team to do 3 complete attempts, if they just place their robot on the field, starts it and then call LoP it is counted as an attempt. 

12. There are nothing that prevent the team from trying more than 3 attempts. The team will never get negative score from trying, but the only thing that the team can earn is the scoring for the obstacles, gaps, speedbumps and intersections between the two checkpoints, the passing itself will yield 0 points. 




# Notes for Rescue Maze Judges: 

&ast; Information that is OK to tell the robot beforehand is the width of the passages, the height of the walls, the temperature range of the victims, such information that is static and the same in every run during the full tournament. 

Information that NOT is OK to tell the robot is the location of victims, walls, checkpoints, blacktiles, if it is favorable to follow the right or left wall in this particular maze, etc. Everything that can vary between different runs. 




1. The definition of visited is "when more than half of the robot is within the tile, when looking from above". 

2. To get the scoring for the ramp the robot needs to be able to leave the tile below the ramp by itself. I.e. if the robot rolls down the ramp and flipped so it can't move from the tile it will not earn the points for the ramp.  However if the tile below the ramp is a checkpoint and more than half of the robot is within that tile it can restart there even if it has flipped over (but still not get the score for the ramp when exiting the tile after the LoP). 

3. To identify a victim the robot needs to stop and flash a light source on and off for 5 seconds OR drops a rescue kit. Both needs to be done within 15 cm proximity of the victim. 

4. The proximity distance for rescue kits is counted where it first touches the ground. No matter of what will happen later. 

5. The robot is only allowed to carry 12 rescue kits. Check this before start! 

6. The robot is allowed to drop more rescue kits but can only score once per victim. A harmed victim will yield more points if they drop 2 kits (one kit still counts as identification).  

7. If the robot has visited a black tile, it needs to go straight backwards, if the robot turns it will be a LoP. 

8. Score for speedbumps in a tile will be given regardless if the robot has actual passed the speedbump or not. It will be enough if the robot has visited the square and subsequently left it (on its own, it is not counted as passed speedbump if the team call LoP in the tile and lift the robot away). 

9. After a LoP the robot should be placed in the last visisted checkpoint. The robot should be completely within the tile when looking from above. It can be turned in any direction, but keep an eye for suspicious behaviour here!
